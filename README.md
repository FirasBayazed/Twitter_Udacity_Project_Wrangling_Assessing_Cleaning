# Twitter_Udacity_Project_Wrangling_Assessing_Cleaning
real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling.  The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent". WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.  WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.

* As a Udacity student, I need to access the Twitter API in order to complete a Data Wrangling student project. In this project, I'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. This data will include retweet count and favorite count. Before I can run my API querying code, I need to set up my own Twitter application. Once I have this set up, I will develop some code to create an API object that I'll use to gather Twitter data. After querying each tweet ID, I will write its JSON data to a tweet_json.txt file with each tweet's JSON data on its own line. I will then read this file, line by line, to create a pandas DataFrame that I will assess and clean. I may post this completed project on my GitHub account, where it will get viewers. Otherwise there will be no other readers or users of my Twitter data or project analysis beyond the Udacity instructors and reviewers *

# Project Details

We will perform the following tasks in this project:

Data wrangling, which consists of:

  -  Gathering data

  -  Assessing data

  -  Cleaning data

Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data

Reporting on 1) data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations



# The following packages (i.e. libraries) need to be installed.

   - pandas

   - numpy

   - requests

   - tweepy

   - json
   
 # The Data
Enhanced Twitter Archive

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) to make this Twitter archive "enhanced."
Additional Data via the Twitter API

Back to the basic-ness of Twitter archives: retweet count and favorite count are two of the notable column omissions. Fortunately, this additional data can be gathered by anyone from Twitter's API. Well, "anyone" who has access to data for the 3000 most recent tweets, at least. But we, because we have the WeRateDogs Twitter archive and specifically the tweet IDs within it, can gather this data for all 5000+. And guess what? We're going to query Twitter's API to gather this valuable data.
Image Predictions File

One more cool thing: I ran every image in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive through a neural network that can classify breeds of dogs. The results: a table full of image predictions (the top three only) alongside each tweet ID, image URL, and the image number that corresponded to the most confident prediction (numbered 1 to 4 since tweets can have up to four images).
